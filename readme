texture packer
    packs multiple images into one and generates a header file with
    the coordinates of all files.

how to use?
    texture_packer.exe output_name a.png b.png ...
    this generates two files:
        output_name.png: image of 2048x2048 pixels containing a.png, b.png, etc in one file.
        output_name.h: contains the path, coordinates and dimensions of all images.

build/installation/compile
    run build.bat or simply use the texture_packer.exe included in the 
    repository.
